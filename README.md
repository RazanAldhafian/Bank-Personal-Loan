# Problem
(Thera Bank) which has a growing customer base. In this bank, most of the customers are liability customers ,or depositors, with varying sizes of deposits.
In addition, the number of customers who are borrowers, known as asset customers, is quite small.
To conclude, the dataset is studying the ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers while keeping them as depositors.
Since the bank is interested in expanding the loan interest base rapidly.
It will do so by encouraging the marketing department to devise campaigns that better target the customers.
Hence, this will increase the success ratio of the personal loan campaign with minimal budget, therefore, bringing in an increased profit through the loan interest.

# Solution
the data mining tasks used will be Classification and Clustering.
In classification, we will seek to identify the potential customers willing to purchase the loan.
Therefore, the class attribute will be the probability of customers to accept a personal loan {high probability, low probability}, using the “personal loan” attribute as a class label.
The goal of classification is to accurately predict the target class for each customer in the data, thus, predicting the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans.
In clustering, we will partition a set of numeric data objects into subsets (clusters), where objects in a cluster are similar to one another, yet dissimilar to objects in other clusters.
The goal of clustering is to cluster the data with minimal overlap such that the intra class similarity is maximized and the inter class similarity is minimized ,hence, we will study the customers’ behavior in order to group them based on their similar characteristics.
